This experience taught me incredible resilience and adaptability. I discovered strengths I didn't know I possessed and developed a deeper appreciation for small pleasures and daily moments of wellbeing. It also forced me to become more intentional about how I spend my time and energy, which has actually led to a richer, more focused life.
